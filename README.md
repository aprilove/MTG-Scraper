# MTG Scraper
Scrapes useful data off MTGGOLDFISH using Puppeteer.
MTGGOLDFISH's price history can be found at: document.querySelector('main > div > script[type="text/javascript"]').innerText.
Through parsing one can recreate a graph or calculate more data related to cards though not necessary for my current task.

## Future Updates
- [ ] Output data as an excel file to automatically graph prices
- [ ] Provide analytics relating to similar cards or reprints
